A reactive form service framework

Building and maintaining forms is arguably one of the most difficult aspects of front-end development. This package provides a powerful way of managing form data and dynamic validation. Works well with reactive component libraries such as `LitElement` and `react`, but works well with other libraries as well. The examples work well with `LitElement` and class-based `react` components, and a React hook has been developed to work in that context.

## Features

- Facilitates form state
- Triggers efficient re-renders for reactive components
- Keeps track of state dirtiness
- Handles complex data structures
- Provides a validation framework
